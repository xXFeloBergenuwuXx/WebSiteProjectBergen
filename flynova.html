Upon release, the FlyNova will activate its internal propellers, rising and spinning in the air. You can control it by adjusting the angle of your throw: if you throw it straight, it will come back to you like a boomerang; If you throw it up or to the side, it will follow that direction and then gently descend. Catch it in the air and get ready to launch again!</h2></td>
